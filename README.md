An instant messaging application utilizing Flask and Socket.IO

### TO DO:
##### 1: Refactor Code

### To Run the App:

You will need a Python virtual environment to be set up (Tutorial here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#install-virtualenv)

After this has been completed, you will need to install Flask (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#install-flask)

Once the environment is setup, you may run the application with ```flask run```.
